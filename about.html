            <p class="question">What special features have you done, or attempted, in creating the site that we should know about?</p>
            <p class="answer">I have spent some time on the CSS work try to make it fancier. It was challenging for me to try and move stuff around, but I am happy with what I came out with.</p>
            
            <p class="question">Which parts did you have trouble with?</p>
            <p class="answer">I had trouble here and there. As Graduate Diploma student, this was my first coding assignment, I had been struggling what was going on when error was given. I also had trouble to think how we going to validate and check servers. Also trying to connect server was hard too.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What would you like to do better next time?</p>
            <p class="answer">I would like to manage my coding structure look better. If I could and if there is simpler coding stand for any of my work, I would like to make my code simpler so people can easily understand.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What references/sources you have used to help you learn how to create your website?</p>
            <p class="answer">I have huge help from TA and lecturer also I have looked up on the manuals trying how each function and language works. Also had some help from udemy where I had chance to go step by step with PHP, HTML and CSS.</p>
            
            <p class="question">What you have learnt along the way?</p>
            <p class="answer">A lot, I have learnt how to think about the structure, I also have learnt how to use CSS little bit of bootstrap. A lot about PHP coding and how database work. This have given me to study extra to finish the assignment.</p>
